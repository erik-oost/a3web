Menu page:
- Avoid using only overly generic menu titles 
(can use things such as about, contact, etc. 
but should include more interesting ones as well)
- Also should probably omit using any social links until the contacts
page so users will have less reason to leave the web page.

About page:
- A brief or maybe longer history of the company and the route it has taken to
get where it is now.
- Also includes the companies approach, mission statement, pledges to the
environment/communities for sustainability, etc.

Services page:
- List a breakdown of services and what they entail such as 
Mapping, Web development, Remote sensing, Data management and analysis, etc.
- The text blurbs will involve a generic breakdown of what each service is about
as well as a more specific list of applications/programs that we include with it.
- Each blurb should have some sort of generic visual/picture that easily
illustrates what its about at first glance.

Team page:
- Upload personal pictures alongside a little blurb of position, skillsets
and background.
- Can have a little email icon somewhere around each person to allow for 
direct contact to an individual member.
- 

Awards page:
- List of various made up or maybe real accolades that the company has acquired
over the years illustrating its competence and worth.

Contact page:
- Use this page for social links and all forms of contact info.
- Could also include a fill out form that could be linked to a generic company email.

General Ideas: 
- Hover over abbr tags
- Clean and concise design (avoid clutter)
- ***Responsive Design***
- Each page should have a unique picture maybe in the header or in the background
that makes it distinct from the others allowing for users to know at an instant
they have changed pages. The pictures could also have some sort of relation to the
page material but is probably not entirely necessary.
